# Licensing

[SunCAE](https://www.seamplex.com/suncae) is released under the terms of the [GNU Affero General Public License version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html), or at your option, any later version. This means that you get the four essential freedoms, so you can

 0. **Run** SunCAE as you seem fit (i.e. for any purpose).
 1. **Investigate** the source code to see how
    SunCAE works and to change it (or to hire someone to change it four
    you) as you seem fit (i.e. to suit your needs)
 2. **Redistribute** copies of the source code as
    you seem fit (i.e. to help your neighbor)
 3. **Publish** your changes (or the ones that
    the people you hired made) to the public (i.e. to benefit the
    community).

If you use a *modified* version of SunCAE in your web server, [section 13 of the AGPL license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html#section13) requires you to give a link where your users can get these four freedoms as well. That is to say, if you use a verbatim copy of SunCAE in your server, there is nothing for you to do (because the link is already
provided). But if you exercise freedoms 1 & 3 above and *modify* SunCAE to suit your needs---let\'s say you don\'t like the button \"Add Boundary Condition\" and you change it to \"Add restrains and loads\"---you do need to provide a link for
people to download the modified source code.
